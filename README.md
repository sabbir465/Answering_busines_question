# Answering Business Questions using SQL
In this analysis, I address different business questions of a fictional digital music shop. I use a modified version of of a database called Chinook (https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. A schema diagram for the Chinook database is included in order to get an idead about the database.
